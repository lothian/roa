    "## Steps for Computing Vibrational Raman Optical Activity (VROA)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Geometry/Structure)  Determine the nuclear geometry at which we will compute the spectrum.  Usually, this is obtained from a geometry optimization calculation.  Such a calculation minimizes the energy with respect to displacements of the nuclear positions.  We use the final, converged, lowest-energy structure.  The geometry will be in bohr/au or Angstroms in Cartesian coordinates.  For visualization, there are many tools available.  One way to visualize a geometry is to produce an .xyz file and then open it with a program such as Spartan.  For most methods in QC, analytic first derivatives (of the energy with respect to nuclear coordinates) are available to facilitate geometry optimization steps that include computing the first derivative at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (Hessian)  The hessian is the second derivative of the energy with respect to the nuclear coordinate positions.  The hessian is used to determine the normal modes of vibration, and the corresponding force constants and vibrational frequencies.  In many programs, computation of the hessian is called a \"frequency\" calculation, because you need the hessian to obtain vibrational frequencies.  The hessian in PSI4 may be output into \"file15\", and in CFOUR into \"FCMFINAL\".  For some methods in QC, analytic second derivatives are available.  However, in many cases the hessian must be computed via finite differences of first derivatives (or even of energies).  If the finite-difference step size is sufficiently small and the results are sufficiently converged, the results will be equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside: qauntum chemistry programs may differ in where they place the origin of mass, and how they geometrically orient a molecule in space at the beginning of a calculation.  This has no effect on physical observables, but the latter will change derivatives expressed in Cartesian coordinates.  If you want to directly compare derivatives between programs, then you must ensure that the programs use the same orientation of the molecule, or else rotate the results into the frame of reference used by the other program.  For example, if you delete the first line of file15 from a PSI4 calculation, which contains the number of atoms, the file will (within numerical noise) match FCMFINAL from a CFOUR calculation - IF any difference in the orientation of the molecule is taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (Dipole-moment Derivatives) To compute the infrared intensities, which is the signal strength of absorbance in the infrared region for each vibrational mode, we need the dipole-moment derivatives.  The dipole moment is the first derivative of the energy wrt an applied electric field.  (A molecule with a dipole, i.e., positive and negative ends has a non-zero first-order response to an electric field.)  Dipole-moment derivatives can be thought of in two ways:  1) the derivative of the dipole moment (for each component $\\mu_x,~\\mu_y,~\\mathrm{and}~\\mu_z$) wrt displacement of the nuclear coordinates; or 2) the mixed second derivative of the energy wrt an applied electric field ($E_x,~E_y,~\\mathrm{and}~ E_z$) and the nuclear positions.  The dipole moment derivatives in PSI4 may be stored in \"file17\" and in CFOUR in \"DIPDER\"."

    "4. (Derivatives of more obscure tensors) For VROA, we need the derivatives with respect to nuclear displacements for the following 3 quantities.  The complexity of these quantities is the reason that most QC software packages are not able to compute VROA spectra, or, if they do, they can do so with only very limited options for the electronic structure theory.  These depend on the wavelength of the radiation involved.  So for different experimental wavelengths of incoming light, the computation would need to be redone.\n",

    "* dipole polarizability (the 2nd derivative of the energy wrt an applied electric field; 3x3).\n",
    "* optical rotation tensor (the mixed 2nd derivative of the energy wrt an applied electric field, and an applied magnetic field; 3x3).\n",
    "* electric-dipole/quadrupole polarizability; (3x9)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the derivative of these quantities wrt nuclear displacements, we need to compute them at +/- a small difference for each nuclear coodinate in the system.  If there are $N$ atoms in the molecule, each with xyz coordinates, then there are $3N$ nuclear Cartesian coordinates.  For our finite-difference derivatives, we will need to compute these three tensors at each of $(2)(3N)=6N$ geometries. In an earlier version, if one ran Psi4 with ```properties=['roa']```, then all the needed displaced geometries would be generated, along with subdirectories containing the necessary input files, but this system is now broken and replaced as described later."

    "5. Compute tensors at displaced geometries.  These can be run in parallel, coarse-grained on the same node or on different computing nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. (Compute VROA parameters.) In the original, Cartesian implementation it is at this point that psi4 would read the Hessian, determine the normal modes of vibration in the molecule, and their vibrational frequencies.  Then it would read in the tensor data from the subdirectories and compute the derivatives of tensors along the normal modes.  Then it would compute the VROA parameters.\n",

    "### Newer, Mode-specific Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1-3 stay the same.  Once we get to Step 4, the approach changes.  We use the Hessian to determine the normal modes of vibration.  We then displace +/- along only those normal modes of interest to general displaced geometries.  After the reduced number of tensor calculations is complete, then the finite-differences of the tensors are computed.  The result is now immediatetly the derivate of the tensors wrt to the selected normal modes.  And the VROA parameters are then computed specifically and only for those normal modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* when we determine the normal modes, we project out the translations and rotations so that there are only 3N-5/6 vibrations, immediately saving us 10/12 tensor computations at displaced geometries.\n",
    "* experiments will generally be focused only in a certain spectral region, and we can compute the VROA spectrum only in the wavenumber range of interest\n",
    "* many vibrational modes have a negligible to small VROA signal. We can identify these in advance, say by carrying out a cheap calculation and concentrate our computational efforts on the modes that are most intense, or of greatest interest.  "
